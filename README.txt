Just Another Platformer

Hey there!
This is a very simple platformer game designed by yours truly. 
The main objective of the game is to reach the end before the timer runs out. 

Controls:
A,D-Horizontal movement
W/Space- Jump
S/Down-Crouch

Bugs:
-Jump Animation does not trigger unless you press the jump button twice in succession, which is sad as I liked the jump animation :(. I don't think this is a coding error because it worked smoothly when I tested it the first time... reboot Unity and..
Update: Apparently it works fine, according to a friend of mine. Probably just a system issue on my end then.
